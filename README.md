Project Description
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

The Leaflet-Part-1 folder contains the working project files and folders.
index.html is the webpage used to display the earthquake visualizations.

The static folder contains both the css and js folders used to hold stylesheets and JavaScript files respectively.
style.css is the stylesheet used by the webpage to style the plotted map and the map legend.
logic.js is the JavaScript file used to visualize the earthquake data from the USGS http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php.

Instructions:

Clone the repository.
Open Leaflet-Part-1 folder in VS Code.
Right click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server" to view global earthquake data.
